# OPEN.xtrace
Open Execution Trace Exchange (OPEN.xtrace) is a format that enables data interoperability and exchange between APM tools and software performance engineering (SPE) approaches.
This format enables SPE researchers to develop their approaches in a tool-agnostic and comparable manner.

More details on the format can be found in the paper <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46433-6_7">Towards Performance Tooling Interoperability: An Open Format for Representing Execution Traces</a>, which was presented in the 13th European Workshop on Performance Engineering (EPEW'16).

OPEN.xtrace is a community effort as part of the overall goal to increase interoperability of SPE/APM techniques and tools. If you want to contribute to the development of the format, please visit http://research.spec.org/apm-interoperability/.
