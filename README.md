# OPEN.xtrace
Open Execution Trace Exchange (OPEN.xtrace) is a format that enables data interoperability and exchange between APM tools and software performance engineering (SPE) approaches.
This format enables SPE researchers to develop their approaches in a tool-agnostic and comparable manner. OPEN.xtrace is a community effort as part of the overall goal to increase interoperability of SPE/APM techniques and tools.

More details on the format can be found in the paper "Towards Performance Tooling Interoperability: An Open Format for Representing Execution Traces," which was presented in the 13th European Workshop on Performance Engineering (EPEW'16).
